      <h2>Fragments of Creation</h2>
      <p>Each project tells a story—of effort, creativity, and growth. From hands-on work to heartfelt ideas, these are more than just school tasks; they’re pieces of who we are, shaped by challenges and moments of inspiration. They reflect not only what we've done, but the path we're walking, step by step.</p>
