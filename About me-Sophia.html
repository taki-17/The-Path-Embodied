        <h1>Sophia Ingrid R. Ongoco</h1>
        <p>Helu! I'm Sophia, but you can call me Taki. I am someone who's always curious, always observing, and constantly finding ways to express love and care. I've got a deep love for music—it's how I connect with the world. Whether I'm playing the guitar, piano, drums, or ukulele, music has this way of saying things that words can't. I'm always exploring new instruments and sounds, just seeing where the rhythm takes me. Alongside me is my loving partner, the one who supports me in my life's symphony, through all the highs and lows. We're learning and growing together, and I'm grateful for every step of the journey. </p>

      <h2>Why I Chose 'The Dreaming' Hirono Figurine</h2>
      <div class="dreaming-photo">

      </div>
      <p>I chose "The Dreaming" Hirono Figurine because dreams hold the quiet magic of our truest selves. They flicker like distant stars—blurry, yet they pull us in with a gentle force. Dreams are brief, a fleeting whisper in the dark, listening to the silent stories we tell ourselves. No one can see what happens in dreams, but they shape us in ways we don’t always understand. The shadows and shifting light reveal more than we can grasp, showing who we really are deep inside. This figure speaks to the hidden parts of me, the ones I keep tucked away, where no one can see—where my truest self rests, in the quiet darkness, waiting to be understood.</p>
